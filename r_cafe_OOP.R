# S3 S4 R6 (S7 New! https://github.com/RConsortium/S7)
# S3 and S4 are base R, R6 is R6 package

# S3 - Râ€™s original, informal OOP system;
# S4 - a more formal less flexible version of S3 (Bioconductor uses);
# RC - a reference class OOP system that more closely resembles the encapsulated object paradigm used in languages like C++ and Python.

# What is OOP? See figure
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-object-oriented-programming/

# Polymorphism (many shapes) - same interface but differing data types
# Encapsulation - combine data/attributes and methods into a unit

# https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/

# Think about a bus
# Bus is a class (blueprint) - how to make, knows what it can do, describes its parts
# Attributes are number seats, windows, top speed, mpg
# Methods are what it can do: open/close door, steer, accelerate or brake
# Inheritance "party bus" - additional attributes or methods, like fridge, window blinds

# Everything in R is an object

# When an object has more than one class, R searches successively through the class attribute until a suitable method is found.
