  domgross = 118450002,
  imdb_rating = 7.8,

## A gtsummary example

```{r}
library(gtsummary)

# Add p-values
tbl_uvreg <- 
  trial %>% 
  tbl_uvregression(
    method = glm,
    y = response,
    method.args = list(family = binomial),
    exponentiate = TRUE
  )
```

```{r}
tbl_uvreg
```

The odds ratio for age is `r inline_text(tbl_uvreg, variable = age)`
